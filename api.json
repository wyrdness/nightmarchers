      "full": "The **Night Marchers** (Hawaiian: **Huaka'i pō**, \\\"spirit procession\\\") are ghostly processions of ancient Hawaiian warriors' spirits who march from dusk to dawn along sacred paths throughout the Hawaiian Islands. These are the spirits of deceased ali'i (chiefs), warriors, and their attendants, returning to their resting places and protecting ancestral sites. The procession is announced by the sound of drums (pahu), chanting, and the blowing of conch shells (pū). Torches light their way as they march in military formation, dressed in traditional Hawaiian warrior garb and carrying ancient weapons. The Night Marchers follow ancient trails regardless of modern development, passing through cities and over highways as they trace their sacred paths."
