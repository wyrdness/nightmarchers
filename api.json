      "summary": "Huaka'i pō, or Night Marchers, are ghostly processions of ancient Hawaiian warriors' spirits who march from dusk to dawn along sacred paths, returning to their resting places. Looking directly at them brings death unless an ancestor is among them.",
      "full": "The Night Marchers, known in Hawaiian as Huaka'i pō (spirit procession), are one of the most sacred and feared phenomena in Hawaiian spiritual tradition. They are the spirits of ancient Hawaiian warriors, ali'i (chiefs), and their attendants who march in ghostly procession through the night, following ancient trails and sacred paths. The procession is heralded by the sound of drums, chanting, and the blowing of conch shells (pū), accompanied by torches lighting the way. These warriors, dressed in traditional garb and carrying weapons, march from sunset to sunrise, returning to their resting places. Witnessing the Night Marchers is extremely dangerous—looking directly at them means certain death, with the only exception being if one of your ancestors is among the procession. To survive an encounter, one must immediately strip naked and lie face down, showing complete respect and submission. The Night Marchers are not malevolent but are protecting sacred sites and ancestral paths. Modern sightings continue to be reported, especially near historical sites, burial grounds, and along ancient trails."
