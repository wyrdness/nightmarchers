## Overview

The **Night Marchers** (Hawaiian: **Huaka'i pō**, "spirit procession") are ghostly processions of ancient Hawaiian warriors' spirits who march from dusk to dawn along sacred paths throughout the Hawaiian Islands. These are the spirits of deceased ali'i (chiefs), warriors, and their attendants, returning to their resting places and protecting ancestral sites.

The procession is announced by the sound of drums (pahu), chanting, and the blowing of conch shells (pū). Torches light their way as they march in military formation, dressed in traditional Hawaiian warrior garb and carrying ancient weapons. The Night Marchers follow ancient trails regardless of modern development, passing through cities and over highways as they trace their sacred paths.

**Witnessing the Night Marchers is extremely dangerous**. Looking directly at them means certain death—the only exception being if one of your ancestors is among the procession. To survive an encounter, one must immediately strip naked and lie face down, showing complete submission and respect.

The Night Marchers are not malevolent spirits but protective ancestors guarding sacred sites and spiritual paths. Modern sightings continue to be reported throughout Hawaii, especially near historical battlegrounds, burial sites, and ancient heiau (temples).

### Timeline

- **Mana** (spiritual power) is real and tangible

- **Land and spirits are interconnected**

The Night Marchers embody these beliefs, representing the continued presence and protection of Hawaiian ancestors.
